This repository showcases a common error in Rust involving unsafe raw pointers and vectors. The `bug.rs` file contains code that attempts to modify the vector's contents directly through a raw pointer. This is dangerous because it can easily lead to data corruption if the pointer becomes invalid.  The solution provided in `bugSolution.rs` demonstrates a safer approach to memory manipulation.  It is crucial to understand the implications of using raw pointers in Rust to avoid unexpected behavior and memory safety issues.
